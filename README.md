# Discord_Bot1_For_Mentorship_Program_IIUC
Tracksheet Bot 


This bot is developed for IIUC-Mentorship Program. A discord server is on going for every Final semester student. 
They complete some tasks regularly on the basis of two categories known as Problem Solving and Development. 
They updates their tasks in the discord server using / slash commands. 
After every week the mentors who are mentoring these students they also use the bot for the weekly assesment. 
They use /Weekly_evaluation slash command to upgrade the evaluation. 
The most iconic part of the task is whenever the mentors and the mentee update through the slash commands the details transferred to a google sheet. 
That's why this is a tracksheet bot.
